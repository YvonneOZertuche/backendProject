# Blogs


## Description:

Welcome to the Blogs site! Glad you stopped by. This website gives users an opportunity to create, and display, blog posts. We used Node.js, JavaScript, ElephantSQL, PostgreSQL, Sequelize to create the project.

## How to use this project:

Here at Blogs, we believe that creating a blog post about your thoughts/feelings, no matter how small they may seem, is important. If you would like to participate, please create an account using the register page. Once you've registered, log in and begin crafting your first post. Anytime you leave, please log out. And when you return, be sure to log back in to see your blogs, make any edits or delete any that you've changed your mind on. 

Caution: once a blog post is deleted, it is gone forever. (for real, we've built it to delete from the database so don't play it fast or loose)
